# Java-Basics&OOPS

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Java code examples, tutorials, and resources to help you learn the Java programming language. If you are a beginner looking to get started with Java , this repository has something for you.


## Introduction

Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is known for its platform independence, robustness, and extensive standard library. Java is used for building a wide range of applications, from desktop and mobile apps to enterprise systems and web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Java, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use a package manager if available for your operating system.

Once you have installed the JDK, you can compile and run Java code using a command-line compiler or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or anyother IDE which suits you.


## Java Basics

The `java-basics` directory contains a set of examples and tutorials covering the fundamental concepts of the Java language. It includes Syntactical introduction to java boilerplate and how A simple code is written in Java.


## Operator and Expression

In Java, an operator is a symbol that performs operations on variables or values, such as arithmetic or logical manipulations. On the other hand, an expression is a combination of variables, operators, and literals that evaluates to a single value, representing a computation or a result in the Java programming language.


## Control Flow 


In Java, control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. It is managed by control flow structures like conditional statements (if, else if, else) and iterative statements (for, while, do-while). These structures enable developers to dictate the flow of execution based on conditions or repetitions, facilitating the creation of dynamic and responsive Java programs.


## Object-Oriented Programming

The `object-oriented-programming` directory explores the object-oriented nature of Java. It covers topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building modular and maintainable Java applications.


## Testing and Debugging

The `testing-and-debugging` directory focuses on testing and debugging Java applications. It covers unit testing with JUnit, debugging techniques, logging, and performance profiling. These skills are essential for ensuring the reliability and quality of your code.

## Best Practices

The `best-practices` directory provides guidelines and best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient Java code. It covers topics such as code organization, naming conventions, error handling, documentation, and performance optimization.

## Resources

The `resources` directory contains additional resources, including books, websites, tutorials, and online courses, to further enhance your understanding of Java.
